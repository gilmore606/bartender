    <string name="vodka">Vodka is a distilled beverage composed primarily of water and ethanol, sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings. Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of fermented cereal grains or potatoes, though some modern brands use other substances, such as fruits or sugar.   Vodka is traditionally drunk neat (not mixed with any water, ice, or other mixer), though it is often served chilled in the vodka belt countries (Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine). </string>
    <string name="gin">Gin is a liquor with some level of juniper flavor that’s bottled at at least 40 percent alcohol by volume. The U.S. government defines gin as a liquid “produced by distillation or mixing of spirits with juniper berries and other aromatics or extracts.”  Juniper, gin’s defining characteristic, tastes primarily like pine, but is also herbaceous and floral. Gin production dates back to the Dutch genever, a wine-based medicinal spirit. The English got a hold of genever during the 80 Years War and the 30 Years War in the 1600s, where it was referred to as “Dutch courage.”</string>
    <string name="rum">Rum is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane byproducts, such as molasses, or directly from sugarcane juice, by a process of fermentation and distillation. The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels. The majority of the world\'s rum production occurs in the Caribbean and Latin America. Rum is also produced in Scotland, Austria, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the Philippines, India, Reunion Island, Mauritius, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, the United States, and Canada. Rums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas "golden" and "dark" rums were typically consumed straight or neat, on the rocks, or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are also available, made to be consumed either straight or iced. Rum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as in The Maritimes and Newfoundland. This beverage has famous associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo).</string>
    <string name="tequila">Tequila is a regionally specific distilled beverage and type of alcoholic drink made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila, 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in the highlands (Los Altos) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. Aside from differences in region of origin, tequila is a type of mezcal (and the regions of production of the two drinks are overlapping). The distinction in the method of production is that tequila must use only blue agave plants rather than any type of agave. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime across the rest of the world. The red volcanic soil in the region around the city of Tequila is particularly well suited to the growing of the blue agave, and more than 300 million of the plants are harvested there each year. </string>
    <string name="whiskey">Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels. </string>
    <string name="ale">Ale is a type of beer brewed using a warm fermentation method, resulting in a sweet, full-bodied and fruity taste. Historically, the term referred to a drink brewed without hops. As with most beers, ale typically has a bittering agent to balance the sweetness of the malt and act as a preservative. Ale was originally bittered with gruit, a mixture of herbs or spices boiled in the wort before fermentation. Later, hops replaced gruit as the bittering agent. Ale, along with bread, was an important source of nutrition in the medieval world, particularly small beer, also known as table beer or mild beer, which was highly nutritious, contained just enough alcohol to act as a preservative, and provided hydration without intoxicating effects.</string>
    <string name="amaretto">Amaretto (Italian for "a little bitter") is a sweet, almond-flavoured, Italian liqueur associated with Saronno, Italy. Various commercial brands are made from a base of apricot pits, almonds, or both. When served as a beverage, amaretto can be drunk by itself, used as an ingredient to create several popular mixed drinks, or added to coffee. Amaretto is also commonly used in culinary applications. The name amaretto originated as a diminutive of the Italian word amaro, meaning "bitter", which references the distinctive flavour lent by the mandorla amara (the bitter almond) or by the drupe kernel. However, the bitterness of amaretto tends to be mild, and sweeteners—and sometimes sweet almonds—enhance the flavour in the final products. </string>
    <string name="absinthe">Few other distilled spirits have lived the long hard, magical, mystical life of Absinthe. Years before the 18th Amendment, best known as Prohibition was ratified in the U.S. in 1919 this often misunderstood green spirit – Absinthe, La Fee verte or The Green Lady – was banned in 1912. The Absinthe ban was based on a belief that the green liquid inside the bottle was hallucinogenic. When the 21st Amendment ended Prohibition in 1933 the ban on Absinthe remained. In fact, that ban remained in effect until 95 years later when the TTB along with the FDA authorized the sale of Absinthe in the U.S.\nAbsinthe is produced much like gin. It’s a high-proof neutral spirit generally 110 to 144 proof and is infused with a blend of botanicals. It can be many botanicals but the three main herbs used in production of absinthe are Grande Wormwood, Green Anise and Sweet Fennel. Traditionally, the alcohol is infused a second time before bottling to intensify the flavor and create the signature green color. </string>
    <string name="anejo_rum">Anejo Rum is a golden blend of rich, aged rums with a mellow taste and rich aroma.</string>
    <string name="angostura_bitters">This name brand of bitters is said to contain over 40 ingredients — although few can know for sure, since the recipe, which was developed as medicine by Dr. Johann Siegert, physician to Simon Bolivar, in Venezuela in 1824, is a closely guarded secret. Unlike many other bitters, Angostura isn\'t a citrus blend, but rather contains water, vegetable flavoring extracts, and a bitter root called gentian. It is also 44.7 percent alcohol by volume, and, contrary to belief, doesn\'t contain Angostura bark.</string>
    <string name="aperol">An Italian aperitif made from gentian, rhubarb, and cinchona, Aperol is sometimes thought of as the little brother of Campari.  In 1919, Aperol was born. It gained popularity through the 1920s, and in the 1930s, it became a drink “for women and sportive people.” Advertisements around Italy marketed the drink as something to help the fitness conscious stay “lean and fit.” </string>
    <string name="applejack">Applejack is a strong apple-flavored alcoholic drink produced from apples, popular in the American colonial era. The name derives from "jacking", a term for "increasing" and specifically for "freeze distilling", the traditional method of producing the drink.</string>
    <string name="aquavit">Akvavit or aquavit is a distilled spirit that is principally produced in Scandinavia, where it has been produced since the 15th century. \nA neutral spirit distilled from grain or potato (much like vodka), aquavit is most commonly flavored with caraway as its dominant spice. Styles of aquavit vary and often include a range of other spices as well, such as dill, fennel, coriander, citrus and anise.</string>
    <string name="averna">Averna is a popular Italian bitter liqueur (classified as an amaro) that is still produced from the original 1868 recipe of natural ingredients. The herbs, roots, and citrus are allowed to infuse in the base liquor for two extended periods of time. What exactly is included in this herbal blend is a mystery (or secret) for the most part, but pomegranate and the essential oils of bitter lemons are included in the list.\nAverna is dark brown, thick, and is best described as being bittersweet. It is sweeter than many Amari and you will note hints of anise, citrus, juniper berries, myrtle, rosemary, and sage in the taste. </string>
    <string name="benedictine">In 1510, the Benedictine monk Don Bernardo Vincelli created the recipe for this French liqueur, which calls for 27 plants and spices. The three main ingredients are Angelica, Hyssop and Lemon Balm.  Only three people on Earth know the complete recipe for making the spirit.</string>
    <string name="bitters">Bitters are made by infusing a neutral spirit with any number of aromatics, including spices, tree bark, roots, seeds, fruits, etc. Since before the cocktail itself, bitters were originally developed and marketed for medicinal purposes, with ingredients generally thought to impart good health preserved in a neutral liquor. As with most marketing campaigns, health claims began to be a bit outlandish—restoring youthful vigor, curing malaria, e.g.—but thankfully for all involved, bitters eventually found their way from the medicine cabinet to the liquor cabinet.\nIn fact, they have such an established place in spirits that even if you’re not a cocktail drinker, you’ve probably heard of a few of the most popular types of bitters. There’s Peychaud’s, used in the Sazerac and developed in 1830 by Antoine Amedee Peychaud, a Haitian apothecary who settled in New Orleans. There’s Angostura, with their oversize label, found in everything from the Old Fashioned to hangover cures. And then, in a different class, orange bitters, clear orange-hued citrus bitters with a complex of lighter-spectrum flavors that vary from brand to brand.</string>
    <string name="blue_curacao">This variant of the orange liqueur curacao is most notable for, let\'s be honest, making drinks turn blue.</string>
    <string name="bourbon">What began as a way for dirt-poor early American farmers to scratch a living from their fields has become one of the world’s great drinks. Kentucky Straight Bourbon has survived temperance, Prohibition and war, all the time refining its character and now enjoying a long-awaited renaissance.\nBourbon\'s roots go back to the late 1700s, when westbound British, Irish and Scottish settlers started making whiskey in Kentucky. In 1964, the US Congress established federal regulations for producing the spirit. All American whiskeys are distilled from a fermented mash (mixture) of cereal grain and water without any coloring or flavoring additives. Unlike Scotch or cognac, American whiskey must by law be aged in new, charred oak barrels and no more than 160-proof (80% alcohol by volume).</string>
    <string name="brandy">Brandy (from brandywine, derived from Dutch brandewijn, gebrande wijn or "burned wine") is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35 to 60 percent alcohol by volume (70 to 120 U.S. proof) and is typically taken as an after-dinner drink. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, some are colored with caramel coloring to imitate the effect of aging, and others are produced using a combination of both aging and coloring. The term brandy also denotes liquors obtained from the wines of other fruits. Apples, cherries, plums, pears and peaches have all been distilled into what are called fruit brandies or eaux-de-vie.</string>
    <string name="cachaca">Cachaça is just beginning to make its mark worldwide. However, this New World spirit is hardly new. In 1532, the Portuguese moved sugar production to Brazil and distillation of the plant into cachaça began shortly thereafter. Today, cachaça is the most popular spirit in Brazil with thousands of brands in existence that range from the cheap and plentiful to the rare bottlings that cost hundreds of dollars. Just like whiskey and beer, many cachaça brands are part of a craft movement that is gaining momentum. Only few brands were exported historically, but even small-production, artisanal cachaça can be found on the world’s shelves today. Cachaça is made from cane juice pressed straight out of raw sugarcane stalks. The fresh juice is fermented and then distilled into the beloved Brazilian beverage. Some rums, usually labeled as Rhum Agricole, are made in the same way, earning cachaça the name “Brazilian rum” in certain places. The major difference between cachaça and common rum is in the juice: most rum is distilled from sugarcane juice that has been processed into molasses, which has a higher sugar content. This makes cachaça have a more grassy, herbaceous flavor than its relative.</string>
    <string name="calvados">Calvados is an apple brandy produced in Normandy, France, made by distilling cider into an eau-de-vie, then aging it in cask. In the same way wine is overwhelmingly made with vitis vinifera grapes, the cider used for Calvados is made with specific apple varieties. Tart, bitter and sweet apple varieties all make their way into the cider blend to help achieve the harmony that’s present in any well-made Calvados. Hundreds of different apples are approved in the region and law mandates that a percentage of every orchard be planted to local varieties. </string>
    <string name="campari">Campari is an aperitif and cocktail ingredient, fairly common in classic cocktail recipes and equally delicious on its own. Perhaps best known for its characteristically bright red color, it tastes bitter and herbal and is still made in Italy, where it originates.\nCampari’s inventor, Gaspare Campari, spend two decades making bitter aperitifs of various recipes, eventually creating the recipe we recognize today as Campari.</string>


    <string name="oldfashioned">The Old Fashioned is one of the most venerable of cocktails, predating not only the motorcar but the presidency of Abe Lincoln. All it takes is serving whiskey, sugar, bitters and, if you like, a cherry or orange garnish on the rocks. Properly made, it\'s strong but not too strong, sweet but not too sweet, and, most importantly, it\'s dead-simple and absolutely delicious.\nThe best bitters for an Old Fashioned are up for debate, but Angostura is classic for a reason, while Fee Brothers offer a welcome alternative.</string>
    <string name="mojito">To many people, the Mojito represents the perfect rum cocktail. The origins of the drink can be traced back to Cuba and the 16th-century Cuban cocktail El Draque, named for Sir Francis Drake.\nAppropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (derived from cane juice) are mixed with soda water to create a refreshing classic cocktail.\nThe Mojito is traditionally served over ice in a highball glass and often associated with summer. Like your cocktails with literary references? You\’re in luck. The Mojito is said to have been a favorite of Ernest Hemingway.</string>
    <string name="longislandicedtea">On paper, the Long Island Iced Tea is one hot mess of a drink. Four different—and disparate—spirits slugging it out in a single glass, along with triple sec, lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat house hazing than one of the world’s most popular cocktails. And yet, somehow, it works.\nThat’s because the Long Island Iced Tea succeeds where so many of today’s refined cocktails fall short: It’s boozy AF—more than four ounces of alcohol against less than half that amount in mixers. Unless you’re a sailor on shore leave, that’s a red-flag ratio rife with morning-after consequences. It’s also precisely what a person needs every now and then.\nBest then not to intellectualize the Long Island Iced Tea and simply love it for what it is: an easy-gulping, one-and-done stiffy. If you\’re looking to tame your tea a bit, pull back the boozy parts from three-quarter ounce to half-ounce, and lean in on the cola. The good people of Long Island won\’t be offended.</string>
    <string name="negroni">Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the Negroni is said to have been invented in Florence by a dauntless Italian count who demanded that the bartender replace the club soda in his Americano with gin. It was a substitution that launched a thousand riffs.\nIn its hundred-year history, few cocktails have encouraged more frenzied experimentation than the beloved Negroni. Its one-to-one-to-one recipe of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth has become the platform on which generations of drink mixers have left their thumbprint.\nBut how do you mix the perfect version? Start by selecting the right base materials. The key to a great Negroni is finding a gin-vermouth pairing that complements, rather than overpowers, the bitter, bold flavors of Campari. Once you zero in on a winning trio, write it down, memorize it, and request it at your favorite bar. You’ll make the count proud.</string>
    <string name="whiskysour">Spirit, sugar, citrus—the original big three—come together in the Whiskey Sour, whose history stretches back to the Lincoln administration. Few drinks in the cocktail canon are as quick to satisfy and endlessly mutable as the Whiskey Sour. Add a flourish to any component, and you have your own personal spin on the classic. We like our Whiskey Sour thickened with egg white and a few dashes of aromatic bitters for a complementary spice note.</string>
    <string name="martini">You could stumble down a very deep, very dark rabbit hole trying to determine who mixed the world’s first Martini. Was it a California prospector during the 1849 Gold Rush or the barman at a flossy New York City hotel 50 years later? Both stories hold water. Neither will leave you feeling as blissful and content as a well-made Dry Martini.\nStart with a good London-style gin. From there, add a little (not too much!) dry vermouth and dash of orange bitters. And despite the prissy demands of a certain fictional British spy, stir (don’t shake!) the hell out of it with ice and strain it into a glass named after the cocktail itself. Twist a lemon peel, and there you have it, a Dry Martini. It’s a drink worth getting to the bottom of.</string>
    <string name="daiquiri">No drink has suffered more abuse than the Daiquiri. In the roughly 130 years since its inception, the granddaddy of rum cocktails has gone from the pride of Havana to an unloved extra on the back of a Señor Frog’s table tent. Even today, as the craft cocktail movement reaches full tilt, most people too often associate the Daiquiri with adult slushies, the stuff of spring break blackouts and mind-splitting hangovers.\nBut in its purest form, the Daiquiri is simple and sublime, a delicate blend of rum’s sweetness with the raw freshness of sugar and lime juice. Whole lives have been dedicated to balancing the three. That each ingredient should be of the highest quality goes without saying, though even then the Daiquiri can throw you a curve. Choose a too-sweet rum, and you’re sipping liquid candy; overdo the citrus, and the cocktail drowns in a puckering pool of acidity.</string>
    <string name="margarita">Tequila, orange liqueur, lime: The perfect margarita is all about fresh, crisp flavors. After testing all the ratios, this is the one we reach for.\nA good quality tequila needs no sugar to balance the acidity of lime juice beyond triple sec.</string>
    <string name="manhattan">The Manhattan was the most famous cocktail in the world shortly after it was invented in New York City’s Manhattan Club, some time around 1880 (as the story goes). Over the years, the whiskey classic has dipped in and out of fashion before finding its footing as one of the cornerstones of the craft cocktail renaissance.\nAmazingly, the drink that socialites tipped to their lips in the 19th century looks and tastes pretty much the same as the one served today at any decent cocktail bar. The Manhattan’s mix of American whiskey and Italian vermouth, perked up with a few dashes of aromatic bitters, is timeless and tasty—the very definition of what a cocktail should be.\nEarly versions call for rye, with its spicier, edgier profile. Purists claim that it’s not a Manhattan without it, but who has ever had fun drinking with a purist? We find that bourbon creates a beautiful, if mellower, drink. And while Angostura bitters are a must in any variation, a single dash of orange bitters helps brighten the cocktail’s edges, bringing the whiskey and vermouth together seamlessly.</string>
    <string name="moscowmule">This spicy vodka and ginger cocktail bites back. The Moscow Mule marries the clear spirit with ginger for a spicy kick. Lime adds a citrusy touch for a taste that will keep you coming back for more.\nThis cocktail traditionally comes in a copper mug, but feel free even if you don\'t have one.</string>
    <string name="alabamaslammer">The Alabama Slammer might just be the most ’70s of the bright and fruity 1970s cocktails. Its base blend of amaretto, sloe gin and SoCo stands in total defiance of what one would expect from a staunch Southern sipper. Yet the drink looms large below the Mason-Dixon line and beyond.\nSaid to have been born at the University of Alabama, the Slammer is a go-to at Crimson Tide tailgates, where’s it’s often served as a shot. And slamming one back certainly gets the point across. The nutty, herbal notes, backed by baking spices and citrus, come through loud and clear in a single bite.\nBut to truly appreciate the schizophrenia of the Alabama Slammer, mix it in a tall glass with lots of ice and freshly squeezed orange juice, and allow the mix to dilute for a minute or two. The flavors will loosen up and unfold at a leisurely pace, leaving you with a mellower, more Southern-tasting drink.</string>
    <string name="alaska">This gin cocktail, made with Yellow Chartreuse and orange bitters, “dances between spirit-driven and citrus-forward,” according to Keli Rivers of San Francisco’s Whitechapel. “It’s good, moving from one side of the spectrum to the other.”</string>
    <string name="alexander">The Brandy Alexander is a luxurious, creamy cocktail that has been popular throughout the 20th century. It is a brandy version of the gin-based Alexander cocktail and, honestly, brandy does make the better Alexander.</string>
    <string name="algonquin">Some of New York’s greatest writers (and drinkers) once sat at the Algonquin Hotel’s Round Table on 44th Street. Among the wisecracking guests at this literary luncheon were Harpo Marx, Robert Benchley and the martini-loving Dorothy Parker. It’s titillating to assume that with such large and mischievous personalities gathered in one room, even during Prohibition, a flask or two was always present. The hotel was long dry before the Temperance movement, owing to its puritanical owner Frank Case, but it didn’t stop the Algonquin Hotel from later christening a few house cocktails including this American jumble of spicy rye, dry vermouth and sweet pineapple. </string>
    <string name="allies">This drink was created during WWI and is named after the alliance between England, Russia, and France. It incorporates a spirit from each of the countries and is a fantastic riff off a classic martini.</string>
    <string name="amarettorose">Drinks involving amaretto, like the B-52, are usually among the sweetest treats in the cocktail world. This drink is a little bit of an exception, as the club soda mellows dilutes the effect and the lime contrasts sharply with the amaretto’s sweetness.</string>
    <string name="applecar">A delicious apple-themed variant of the classic Sidecar.</string>
    <string name="arthurtompkins">Arthur S. Tompkins was a justice of the New York State Supreme Court in the early 20th century; we can only assume this tasty pairing was named for him.</string>
    <string name="artillery">We owe this classic southern cocktail to the Chatham Artillery, Georgia\'s oldest military unit. The fine folks of Savannah have been mixing up this potent potable since at least the late 1700s. Legend has it that sometime around 1791, George Washington came to visit the Chatham Artillery on short notice. In keeping with their southern hospitality, the artillery members and their wives threw together what they had on hand and created this punch, which they then served at a ball in the president\'s honor. The punch was a hit and became a southern tradition, often being mixed in horse buckets when served in larger quantities. </string>
    <string name="balmoral">Invented at the historic Balmoral bar in Edinburgh, Scotland.</string>
    <string name="bermudahighball">A twist on the basic Highball, this refreshing drink is for those moments when you just want to disappear.</string>
    <string name="blackrussian">It takes a good drink to survive a Moscow winter. This recipe renders a fairly dry version of the drink. You can use more Kahlúa and less vodka to make a sweeter version.</string>
    <string name="blackthorn">This Irish-whiskey Manhattan has a subtle anise note.  For even more subtlety, use the absinthe to rinse the glass before filling with the drink, instead of adding it to the mixture.</string>
    <string name="bloodymary">This classic Bloody Mary recipe probably dates back to the 1920s. Ever since then, bartenders have been working to improve it, and there are some fantastic variations out there. This is the simple, no-frills classic version of the recipe.</string>
    <string name="bobbyburns">Practice your couplets and quatrains while sipping this cocktail named for the Scottish poet.</string>
    <string name="caipirinha">The national cocktail of Brazil, this refreshing summer classic features Cachaca, a Brazilian liquor similar to rum.</string>
    <string name="casablanca">  As many memorable movies do especially ones that already contain numerous references to liquor and drinking, Casablanca spawned a variety of cocktail recipes in its honor.  </string>
    <string name="casinoroyale">The Casino Royale cocktail was probably named after the first James Bond novel, and it has the sort of ingredient list you expect from the drinks of the sixties.\nBecause the lemon and cherry are so well-balanced in this recipe, the flavor of your gin comes through strongly and it’s worth using a good one.</string>
    <string name="champagnecocktail">According to master mixologist Dale DeGroff, this is one of the few original cocktails that appeared in the first (1862) version of the seminal How to Mix Drinks by Jerry Thomas. The recipe has remained unchanged for 150 years.</string>
    <string name="chicagofizz">The Chicago Fizz is a classic mixed drink that is a rich, eye-opening fizz with dark rum and ruby port as the base. It is a fantastic blast from the past and a sophisticated sipping drink with a lot of style and flavor.\nAs the name indicates, the Chicago Fizz has its roots in the Windy City. Who created it or how it came to be is probably lost to history. We do know that sometime before Prohibition it traveled the country and was served in the bar at the Waldorf-Astoria. It had its brief fame and, though it is a great drink, quickly became an obscure cocktail found in only a handful of bar books.</string>
    <string name="ginfizz">Love the Tom Collins? Try its frothy, bubbly cousin, the Gin Fizz. The secret to creating the perfect creaminess and froth is to shake, shake, shake—and then shake some more.</string>
    <string name="kamikaze">The Kamikaze was designed to cut to the chase. Invented on an American naval base in Japan after World War II and made popular during the great reign of vodka of the 1970s and ’80s, the Kamikaze isn’t the kind of cocktail bartenders sit around contemplating in hushed, reverent tones.\nIn fact, it’s not really a cocktail at all. The combination of vodka, lime juice and orange liqueur is served ice-cold as a shot and consumed, more often than not, in less time than it takes to assemble.</string>
    <string name="lochlomond">The Loch Lomond is so named because it features Drambuie and scotch. The vermouth tends to bring out the black licorice aftertaste of the Drambuie. The overall flavor is complex and just a touch sweet.</string>
    <string name="londontown">The London Town cocktail blends gin with maraschino liqueur, and just a little bit of orange bitters to bring them together. The orange bitters and the citrus and herbal notes in the gin bring out the tart side of the cherry flavor.</string>
    <string name="maitai">The Mai Tai is perhaps the most famous Tiki cocktail for a good reason. Trader Vic’s is credited with inventing the drink, and the first person to try it was said to cry out “Mai Tai!” which means “the best—out of this world” in Tahitian. The Mai Tai took a star turn by earning a prominent role in the Elvis film Blue Hawaii.\nThe Mai Tai was created as a way to showcase the flavors of good-quality rum. It should never be neon-colored or overly sweet. A proper Mai Tai is a deep amber hue and allows the rum to shine through with the other ingredients. While some Mai Tai variants call for pineapple juice, this recipe omits it in favor of the more classic recipe favored by Martin Cate’s award-winning Tiki bar Smuggler’s Cove.</string>
    <string name="martinez">This classic recipe first appeared in O.H. Byron’s 1884 “Modern Bartenders’ Guide.”</string>
    <string name="pinklady">The Pink Lady was popular in the 1950s. It’s pink and opaque, so on first sight you might expect it to be cloyingly sweet, but it’s actually drier than most modern cocktails.</string>
    <string name="queencharlotte"> This one is named after Charlotte Amalie, the capital of the US Virgin Islands, which itself was named after Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, queen consort to the Danish King Christian V. </string>
    <string name="sazerac">A close cousin to the Old Fashioned, the Sazerac has been kicking around in one form or another since 1840. In 2008, it was crowned the official cocktail of New Orleans, a designation more suited to marketers than drink mixers. The truth is the Sazerac has always belonged to the Crescent City.\nUp until the late 1800s, it was made with French brandy as a base—Sazerac de Forge et Fils, to be exact—before bartenders switched to rye, the spirit newly arriving by the barge-load down the Mississippi. A well-made Rye Sazerac is indeed a tasty thing, full of spice and depth.</string>
    <string name="sidecar">The Ritz Hotel in Paris claims to have created this cocktail in the early 20th century. The potent combination of Cognac and orange-flavored liqueur shaken until ice cold with lemon juice is a timeless classic.</string>
    <string name="tomcollins"> The Tom Collins is essentially a sparkling lemonade spiked with a healthy dose of the juniper spirit. While there is a debate which side of the pond this drink was born, this cocktail lives up to his classic status with every sip.</string>
    <string name="tuxedo">The drink’s name refers to the Tuxedo Park, a sort of early experiment in country club living established in 1886 about 35 miles from Jersey City. </string>
    <string name="vermouthcassis">The Vermouth Cassis is a very simple and light drink, ideal for those times you want something with just a touch of alcohol, but a whole lot of refreshment. The name says it all; it is a mix of dry vermouth and creme de cassis served over ice and topped with soda.</string>
    <string name="sexonthebeach">Sex on the Beach sports a provocative name for a harmless fruity cocktail. It’s easy to make and even easier to drink, so it’s perfect for your next tropical vacation or cocktail party.\nNo one can seem to agree on where the name Sex on the Beach originated, but many suggest the cocktail may have been invented when a bartender combined a Fuzzy Navel with a Cape Codder. The fruity sipper is served over ice in a Highball glass and garnished with an orange slice.</string>
    <string name="piscosour">The national cocktail of Chile and Peru, this drink may have evolved from the Pisco Punch, which was all the rage in San Francisco during the 1849 gold rush.</string>
    <string name="b52">Believed to have originated in the 1970s from a bartender and fan of the iconic band, the B-52 is a classic guilty pleasure armed with three liqueurs. Make this layered shooter in seconds and impress all your friends.</string>
    <string name="tequilasunrise">The Tequila Sunrise, with its bright striations of color, evokes a summer sunrise. This simple classic has only three ingredients—tequila, grenadine and orange juice—and is served unmixed to preserve the color of each layer.\nThe Tequila Sunrise was created by Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice in Sausalito, Calif. The cocktail achieved notoriety after Mick Jagger began drinking it, and The Rolling Stones dubbed their 1972 tour “the cocaine and Tequila Sunrise tour.” The drink has been a part of the cocktail canon ever since.</string>

    <string name="aviation">A classic gin sipper dating back to the turn of the 20th century, the Aviation was all but forgotten until about a decade ago. That’s when its secret-weapon ingredient, crème de violette, reappeared on the American market. Today, the cocktail is distinguished by its purple-bluish hue and floral, citrus flavors. And to that we say, welcome back!</string>
    <string name="betweenthesheets">Add a little rum to the Sidecar and you get this provocatively named classic.</string>
    <string name="marypickford">Sweet but with a real kick, just like its namesake.</string>
    <string name="monkeygland">In his 1922 ABC of Mixing Cocktails book, Harry McElhone (owner of Harry\'s New York Bar in Paris) took credit for the invention of the Monkey Gland. He also claims that the name was inspired by the 1920s experiments of one Serge Voronoff.\nVoronoff was experimenting with various implants. The most famous of these was the grafting of monkey testicle tissue (or monkey glands) to human testicles.  Voronoff was well-known for this rather shocking technique and over time he received a considerable amount of ridicule for it and died in near obscurity in the 1950s.</string>
    <string name="whitelady">She may look delicate, but this is one strong woman.</string>
    <string name="cosmopolitan">The legendary Cosmopolitan is a simple cocktail with a big history. It reached its height of popularity in the 1990s, when the HBO show “Sex and the City” was at its peak. The pink-hued Martini was a favorite of the characters on the show.\nAccording to Gary Regan, the original Cosmopolitan was created by South Beach bartender Cheryl Cook. Eager to invent a new cocktail for the Martini glass, Cook riffed on the classic Kamikaze using a newly introduced citrus-flavored vodka plus a splash of cranberry juice.</string>
    <string name="frenchconnection">The simple two-ingredient French Connection is one of the best ways to enjoy a young cognac.</string>
    <string name="hemingway">The Hemingway daiquiri has arguably become the most popular variation of this classic rum cocktail, perhaps unseating the undisputed heavyweight champion of the 1990s, the frozen strawberry daiquiri.\nA prolific drinker, Hemingway likely had a number of cocktails named after him. Most had little in common with the legendary writer, but to connect a concoction with the original Most Interesting Man In The World was a good way to sell cocktails.\nWe don’t know if Hemingway ever drank his namesake cocktail at El Floridita. One of Hemingway’s go-to watering holes in Havana created the cocktail to appeal to casual drinkers and leverage the name of one of its most famous patrons.</string>
    <string name="horseneck">This American whiskey classic has only two ingredients.</string>
    <string name="mimosa">The ultimate brunch classic.</string>
    <string name="mintjulep">The Mint Julep is a bourbon cocktail best known for being the signature drink of the Kentucky Derby. But this easy-to-make refresher shouldn’t be reserved for only one day a year. This classic cocktail was created in the southern United States during the 18th century and is still a favorite today.\nThe Mint Julep is traditionally served in a Highball glass or silver Julep cup over crushed ice and garnished with mint. Since bourbon is the only liquid in the drink, you’ll want to use a high-quality bourbon you know you love.</string>
    <string name="rose">A sweet and romantic wine drink, the Rose cocktail was popular in 1920s Paris and was created by Johnny Mitta, barman at the Chatham Hotel.</string>
    <string name="frenchmartini">The French Martini is the drink that helped to kick off the flavored Martini craze of the ’90s. The cocktail was brought to prominence in NYC restauranteur Keith McNally’s Balthazar, where it appeared on the menu after being placed on the menu in one of his other establishments.\nIt’s sweet and creamy due to the pineapple juice and Chambord black raspberry liqueur. The primary spirit is vodka, though sometimes rum is used instead.</string>
    <string name="russianspringpunch">Adapted from a recipe by famed London mixologist Dick Bradsell, this bubbly single-portion punch can easily be scaled up in a punch bowl to serve larger groups.</string>
    <string name="vampiro">The original design of this traditional Mexican take on the Bloody Mary was a combination of tequila and a homemade sangrita, however the use of orange juice with tomato juice and spices in this cocktail recipe bring those together in the build itself. </string>
    <string name="vesper">The Vesper, also known as the Vesper Martini, was made famous by James Bond. The cocktail best known for being ordered “shaken not stirred” was invented by none other than Bond author Ian Fleming. The Vesper first appeared in his book “Casino Royale,” which was published in 1953 and gets its name from fictional double agent Vesper Lynd.\nWhen Bond orders the Vesper, it comes with strict instructions that must be followed by any who make it: “Three measures of Gordon’s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?”</string>
    <string name="yellowbird">You don’t need to be Audubon to appreciate this tasty cocktail.</string>
    <string name="adamneve">Xavier Herit\’s biblically named drink is a nod to the forbidden fruit Adam and Eve couldn’t keep their curious paws off of. \nHerit bottles this cocktail for easy service at his New York City bar Wallflower, but you can serve it up in a coupe glass at home if you prefer.</string>
    <string name="addington">For true vermouth devotees comes this cocktail which is nothing but.</string>
    <string name="ginrickey">If you look at the gin rickey and think it\'s nothing but a gin and tonic without tonic\'s bittersweet bite, you\'d be mostly correct. Dismiss it as a G\+T wannabe, however, and you\'re missing out on one of the great joys of summer. Created in a Washington, D.C., bar called Shoemaker\'s during an especially brutal heat wave in the 1890s—before the advent of air conditioning, you\'ll note—the gin rickey is like an effervescent Frigidaire. Refreshingly bubbly and pleasantly bitter, this Gilded Age cooler demonstrates how your great-grandparents made it through the summer alive.</string>
    <string name="zombie">This tropical drink by legendary Donn Beach of Don the Beachcomber restaurant kicked off the Tiki craze.</string>
    <string name="lastword">The Last Word is a Prohibition-era cocktail that got its beginnings in the Detroit Athletic Club’s bar in the early 1920s. The drink was served at the bar throughout this period and was spread further afield by vaudeville performer Frank Fogarty – also known as the ‘Dublin Minstrel.’\na sweet and sharp drink with a pale green hue and a bite bigger than it’s bark. This little palate cleanser is rich and pungent. It is best suited to those who like a sharp kick to a drink and The Last Word should be the first thing you order the next time you fancy a sweet, citrus hit.</string>
    <string name="ginandtonic">The gin and tonic has a storied history that places it at the heart of the largest empire the world has ever known. Indeed, it is not too much of a stretch to say that the gin and tonic was as essential a weapon for the British Empire as the Gatling gun. No less an authority on imperial power than Winston Churchill once declared, “The gin and tonic has saved more Englishmen’s lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire.”\n</string>
    <string name="peguclub">The Pegu Club is a gin-based cocktail that was the signature drink of Burma\'s Pegu Club. The club, named after a Burmese river, was located just outside Rangoon, and its members were senior government and military officials and prominent businessmen.\nThe Pegu Club is best served in a chilled glass and is considered a hot weather drink. Its taste is reminiscent of grapefruit and some bartenders will garnish it with a twist of grapefruit peel or slice of fresh grapefruit, although it is commonly served with a slice of lime to complement the lime juice in the drink.</string>
    <string name="corpsereviver2">The Corpse Reviver #2 is rightfully considered by many to be the best-tasting of the Corpse Reviver cocktails. It’s one of the staples at Chicago’s gin-focused bar Scofflaw, where bar manager Luke DeYoung calls it “perfectly balanced, refreshing yet still strong. It’s an iconic cocktail that won’t go out of fashion any time soon.”</string>
    <string name="boulevardier">Swap out the gin in a Negroni for rye whiskey and you get the delicious Boulevardier. It’s equally complex as its gin-based predecessor, but the whiskey adds warmth, making it perfect for autumn and winter drinking.</string>
    <string name="bijou">Crisp and herbaceous, the classic Bijou cocktail from the late 1800s blends gin with a bouquet of herbs and spice from Chartreuse and vermouth.</string>
    <string name="gimlet">The Gimlet is a gin-based cocktail that\'s been around since the Jazz Age, if not earlier. The recipe is quite simple, but there are multiple schools of thought on how to prepare it. Gin is always the base, but from there disputes arise. If you\'re using fresh lime juice, some simply syrup is in order. If you\'re using Rose\'s (which some insist you must), no added sugar is needed. Some traditional recipes call for a splash of soda, and others don\'t. It really comes down to personal preference. And if you don\'t like gin? Swap in vodka and you\'re good to go.</string>
    <string name="oatmealcookie">This drink -- which does in fact taste like its namesake -- was originally intended as a shot, but it works just fine as a proper adult-sized drink.</string>
    <string name="laverstoke"> A little more complex in its make-up, the Laverstoke cocktail – named after Bombay Sapphire\'s distillery – is sure to go down a treat this summer. It uses the sweet and herbal notes of Martini vermouth and offsets it with elderflower cordial (or St Germain, a punchy, flavoursome elderflower liqueur, if you\'d prefer), and tops it with ginger ale before adding a touch of ginger and mint for a fresh, lasting finish. The resulting cocktail is a little sweet, a little savoury, a little fiery, and completely delicious. </string>
    <string name="tipperary">Since Saint Patrick was of Gaelic descent, it seems appropriate to mix a little Chartreuse, courtesy of France’s Carthusian monks, into this cocktail that shares a name with a town in southern Ireland. </string>
    <string name="adonis">The Adonis cocktail dates back to the mid-1880s and was named in honor of the first Broadway musical to run for more than 500 performances. Simple and low in alcohol, it’s the perfect weeknight aperitif.</string>
    <string name="affinity">The Affinity Cocktail is an old-school style cocktail, with no fruity liqueurs or fancy herbs. It features two fearsome ounces of scotch, plus dry and sweet vermouth, so it’s technically a double.</string>
    <string name="vieuxcarre">The Vieux Carré was first stirred to life at New Orleans’ legendary Carousel Bar at Hotel Monteleone in the 1930s. Like so many classic cocktails from that city, the recipe represents the crosscurrents of America at the time: brandy and liqueur from France, Italian vermouth, rye whiskey from just up the Mississippi and Caribbean bitters. The Vieux Carré is at once boozy, sweet, bitter and smooth—in other words, New Orleans.</string>
    <string name="bloodnsand">The Blood and Sand is a classic scotch-based cocktail that has withstood the test of time. The recipe first appeared in 1930 in The Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock and has become a mainstay on bar menus ever since.\nIt gets its name from a 1922 bullfighter movie and points to its ingredients: The “blood” represents Heering cherry liqueur, and the “sand” is for the orange juice.\nThe key to the cocktail is to use a smooth scotch that’s not too smoky and freshly squeezed orange juice. So forget about your Islay scotches (for now), and avoid that carton of OJ in the fridge.</string>
    <string name="wardeight">The Ward Eight, a turn-of-the-20th-century concoction, is one of Boston’s major contributions to mixology.</string>
    <string name="baybreeze">The Bay Breeze is a simple mixed drink that brings a little pineapple into the popular mix of vodka and cranberry found in the Cape Codder.
